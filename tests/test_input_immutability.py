"""Fitting and predicting must leave the caller's data exactly as it was.

`clean_data` hands a numeric array straight back rather than casting it into one
it owns, so the array the wrapper carries through `fit` *is* the caller's. What
keeps that safe is `PreprocessingPipeline._process_steps` taking a private copy
before any step mutates anything -- one guarantee, in one place, rather than a
defensive copy at every boundary. Several things inside cleaning and preprocessing
write in place quite deliberately (`_extract_inf_masks` NaNs out infinities,
`process_text_na_dataframe` is documented to mutate the frame it is given), so the
question is not whether anything mutates but whether any of it reaches back to the
caller.

Every input is checked, not just the training features: `y` is label-encoded and
z-normalised on the way through, and the test features take a different route
again -- through `clean_data_transform` and a fitted encoder rather than a fresh
one. Each input kind below reaches cleaning by a different path: a plain numeric
array takes the single-cast shortcut, an object array and a DataFrame go through
pandas, and NaN and +/-inf are rewritten in place internally before the steps run.

    Comparing the caller's array before and after `fit` is not enough to pin this.
    `_extract_inf_masks` NaNs infinities out in place and `_restore_inf_masks`
    writes them back at the end, so a missing copy corrupts the caller's array for
    the duration of the call and then tidies up after itself -- measured, on a
    build with the copy removed: `user_infs 2 -> 0` inside `_process_steps`, and
    `infs 2` again by the time `fit` returns. Every end-to-end check in this module
    passes against that build.

    So watch the boundary instead of the outcome: whatever `_process_steps` hands
    to the first in-place writer must not be the caller's object. That also covers
