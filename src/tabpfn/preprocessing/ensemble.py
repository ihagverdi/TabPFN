            random_state: Random state object for preprocessing. If int, the
                preprocessing will use the same random seed across calls to fit().
            n_preprocessing_jobs: Number of preprocessing jobs to use.
            keep_fitted_cache: Whether to keep the fitted cache for gpu preprocessing.
                For the cpu preprocessors, the cache is always kept implicitly in the
                preprocessor objects.
            enable_gpu_preprocessing: Whether to move quantile/SVD/shuffle to GPU.
            feature_subsampling_method: Method for subsampling features. One of
                "balanced", "random", "constant_and_balanced", or "feature_importance".

                subsample that many samples. If float, subsample that fraction of
                samples. If a list of index arrays, use those indices directly. If
                ``None``, no row subsampling is done.
            sample_subsampling_method: How rows are drawn per estimator when
                ``subsample_samples`` is an int or float. One of "auto", "balanced",

                per estimator when feature_subsampling_method is an importance-based
                method. If float in (0, 1], resolved as ceil(value * n_total_features).
                If "auto", uses 150 when n_features > 200 and n_samples > 100_000,
                otherwise keeps all features (no importance filtering).
            X_train: Training features used to compute feature importance. Required

                is "feature_importance" or sample_subsampling_method is target-aware.
            task_type: ``"classifier"`` or ``"regressor"``, controls whether
                ExtraTreesClassifier or ExtraTreesRegressor is used and resolves

    Scaling only applies to ``n_estimators="auto"``; an explicit integer is always
    returned unchanged, so the package never overrides a value the user chose. An
    explicit value too small to cover every feature warns instead of being raised.

    With balanced feature subsampling each estimator sees at most
    ``max_features_per_estimator`` features. If
    ``n_estimators * max_features_per_estimator < n_total_features`` some features
    are never sampled. For ``"auto"`` this returns the smallest n_estimators that
    covers all features (using the smallest ``max_features_per_estimator`` across the
    supplied configs, which is the binding budget), at least
    ``DEFAULT_N_ESTIMATORS`` and capped at ``MAX_AUTO_SCALED_N_ESTIMATORS``. When
    the cap binds, full coverage is not reached and some features may never be
    sampled unless the user raises ``n_estimators`` explicitly.

    ``auto_scale_n_estimators`` (the deprecated constructor argument of the same
    name) is redundant now that scaling is opt-out by passing an explicit

    ``DEFAULT_N_ESTIMATORS`` without scaling, exactly what passing that integer
